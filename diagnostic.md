# Unix/CLI Diagnostic

## Challenge

Carry out all of the following tasks using _only the command line_! As is
usually the case, you're welcome to use any resource you can find (except
another student, of course) to reach your answer.

## Navigating the Filesystem

Complete each of following steps, **in order** :

1. Create a new directory called `cli-diagnostic` inside the root directory of
this repository (`unix-cli-diagnostic`).

2. Create a new file inside `cli-diagnostic` called `rhyme.txt`.

3. Open `rhyme.txt` using Atom (via the terminal) and add the following text:

 "The rain in Spain falls mainly in the plain."

 Once you've done this, save the file and quit.

4. Make a directory inside `cli-dliagnostic` called `temp`. Inside it, create a new blank file called `temp.md`.

5. Navigate back up to `cli-diagnostic`, and delete the `temp` directory (with `temp.md` inside of it). Use `ls` to show the contents of `cli-diagnostic` - was `temp` deleted?

6.) Navigate back up to `unix-cli-diagnostic` directory.

## Absolute and Relative Paths

Using Atom, open up `diagnostic.md` and write your answers below (where indicated).

1. Is `/Users/blah_blah/Desktop` a relative path or an absolute path? How do you know?

 <!-- Answer Starts Here -->
  It is an absolute path because it starts with / and therefore is listing the full,
  absolute path from the root directory, through the subdirectories to the current directory.
 <!-- Answer Ends Here -->

2. Suppose that we're working on a project, and we want to use a font that's being hosted somewhere on the internet. Would we use an absolute or relative path to refer to it? Why?

 <!-- Answer Starts Here -->
I'm assuming that where the font is being hosted, there is no way to download it onto our own computer to store locally. In that case, we have to use an absolute path because the file for the font is hosted on another server. Relative paths only work for local files.
 <!-- Answer Ends Here -->

3. Now suppose that we have an image file living inside our project. Would we refer to it with an absolute or relative path? Why?

 <!-- Answer Starts Here -->
We would refer to it with a relative path because it lives inside our project and can be accessed locally.
 <!-- Answer Ends Here -->
